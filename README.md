# Starter-Node-Express-EJS-Atomizer-Sass
A starter project for a Node.js, server-rendered web app that uses
- Express.js
- EJS templates
- Atomizer CSS style generator
- Sass CSS preprocessor

The purpose of this project is to provide a fast way to start protyping a node.js website using my preferred toolset, without wasting too much time with initial configuration.
